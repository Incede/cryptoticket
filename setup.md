```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

* Open the terminal from the root project directory and run the below command:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

It will check for docker-compose.yml file in the current directory and will run it. For the first time, it will take some time so be patient.


Once the setup is complete, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the web app.
