## Requirements
  * Docker
  * Docker Engine
  * Docker Compose

## Steps
* Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/Incede/cryptoticket.git
```

* Open the terminal from the root directory and run the below command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

It will check for docker-compose.yml file in the current directory and will run it. For the first time, it will take some time so be patient.

Once the setup is complete, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the web app.
