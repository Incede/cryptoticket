npm install -g create-react-app


Open the terminal from the root project directory and run the below command:

docker-compose up --build


It will check for docker-compose.yml file in the current directory and will run it. For the first time, it will take some time so have patience.


Once everything is running, open the browser and go to localhost:3000 youâ€™ll see the react application running.
